CODE CONVENTIONS
- Indent every loop body by one more space than the outer code.
  - Matching brackets have the same indentation.
  - Opening bracket and closing bracket should occupy a line of their
    own, unless the loop is tiny.
- Put every semantically separate piece of code onto the line of their own.
- Comments should follow these rules:
  - All comments are expected to be lowercase ASCII text.
  - If there's a character belonging to the Brainfuck command set,
    replace it with:
    - '+' -> plus
    - '-' -> minus
    - ',' -> comma
    - '.' -> dot, period
    - '<' -> less than, lt
    - '>' -> greater than, gt
    - '[' -> opening bracket
    - ']' -> closing bracket
    - '#' -> hash
    - '!' -> bang, exclamation mark
  - File-level comment belong to a comment loop, conventional for
    other BF codebases.
  - Block-level comments should precede the block.
    - Optionally, end those with a colon
    - Loop header comments should follow the opening bracket.
      - Closing bracket should have the exact same comment, but with
        "ends" appended to it, as in "[ main loop" -> "] main loop
        ends".
  - Line-level comments should directly follow the code.
  - Comments always start with a space, separating them from the
    commands
  - Comments always end with a newline. No comment-code mixing.
